# Smart Vacuum Cleaner Agent 🚀

An intelligent agent that navigates a 2D grid using A* pathfinding to clean dirty tiles. Built in Python with a Tkinter GUI.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Grid-based room layout with clean, dirty, and wall tiles
- Smart vacuum agent with A* pathfinding logic
- Real-time visualization with Tkinter
- Simulates cleaning process in a dynamic environment

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- `main.py` – Main app logic and GUI rendering
- `agent.py` – Agent class with A* pathfinding and actions
- `room.py` – Grid environment with random dirt and wall generation
